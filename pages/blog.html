          <h2>What the Lone Penguin Made Me Realize</h2>

          <p>
          After watching a viral reel on Instagram, I later found out that it was actually
          from a documentary shot sometime around 2007 or 2008 (not completely sure).
          It showed a group of penguins moving together, except for one penguin who chose
          not to go with them.
          </p>

          <p>
          People had different reactions to it. Some felt sad, some felt confused.
          But what came to my mind was something else.
          </p>

          <p>
          I felt that maybe the penguin had realized that if you want to live your life
          peacefully, you have to be okay with being alone.
          </p>

          <h2>The Temporary Nature of Relationships</h2>

          <p>
          No matter who it is — cousin, wife, son, love, or any relationship —
          none of them are permanent in the way we expect.
          They are part of our life only for a limited time.
          </p>

          <p>
          This is not about hate. This is not about lack of love.
          It is simply the reality of life.
          </p>

          <h2>A Feeling I’ve Had Too</h2>

          <p>
          Sometimes I feel the same way.
          Parents, siblings, friends — people we deeply care about —
          will eventually become busy in their own lives.
          </p>

          <p>
          (Not that I don’t love them. I truly do.
          But I am talking about reality — something you must have felt
          at some point in your life too.)
          </p>

          <p>
          One day, quietly, you realize that you are left alone.
          </p>

          <h2>Choosing Solitude</h2>

          <p>
          So the thought comes —
          why not step away from the world?
          </p>

          <p>
          Not to escape life.
          Not to stop loving people.
          But to protect your peace.
          </p>

          <p>
          Maybe that penguin wasn’t weak.
          Maybe it understood something deeper —
          that sometimes, choosing yourself means walking alone.

            <h1>Growing Together While Finding Yourself</h1>

        <h2>Do You Really Have to Choose Between Love and Self-Growth?</h2>

        <p>
            Somewhere along the way, many of us hear this advice:
            <em>“If you are young, focus only on yourself. Don’t think about love, relationships,
            or having a partner. Become successful first — everything else can wait.”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            It sounds practical. It sounds mature. But honestly, it never fully made sense to me.
        </p>

        <h2>Finding Yourself Is Not a Solo Journey</h2>

        <p>
            The idea that you must completely find yourself before being with someone assumes
            that self-discovery happens in isolation. But life doesn’t work like that.
        </p>

        <p>
            We discover who we are while doing, while learning, while failing, and often —
            while connecting with people.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you don’t fully know yourself yet (and none of us ever completely do),
            how can you be expected to perfectly know whom you deserve?
            Growth isn’t a destination you reach alone and then open the door to others.
            It’s a process that unfolds every day.
        </p>

        <h2>What If You Meet Someone Along the Way?</h2>

        <p>
            While working on your dreams, building your skills, and understanding yourself,
            you may meet someone.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Someone who feels right</li>
            <li>Someone who matches your values</li>
            <li>Someone who makes you feel safe</li>
            <li>Someone who supports your growth</li>
            <li>Someone who grows alongside you</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            When that happens, why should the answer be “not now”?
            Why should success be a prerequisite for connection?
        </p>

        <h2>The Risk of Waiting for “Someday”</h2>

        <p>
            People often say, “Become successful first, then think about love.”
        </p>

        <p>
            But life doesn’t guarantee that the right people will wait,
            or that the people you meet later will value you for who you are.
            Sometimes, waiting only increases the chance of meeting people
            who care more about status, money, or achievements than about character.
        </p>

        <h2>Growing Together Is Also Growth</h2>

        <p>
            Being with the right person doesn’t stop your growth — it can strengthen it.
            Two people learning, evolving, and supporting each other through uncertainty
            can create something meaningful.
        </p>

        <p>
            Love doesn’t always come after success.
            Sometimes, it grows alongside it.
        </p>

        <h2>My Belief</h2>

        <p>
            I don’t believe you must pause your heart to build your future.
            If, while growing and learning, you meet someone who feels right —
            someone you can stand beside, feel safe with, and grow with — then why not?
        </p>

        <p>
            Life is unpredictable. Growth is ongoing.
            And meaningful connections don’t follow fixed timelines.
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p class="note">
            This is not about rushing into love.
            It’s about allowing life to happen — honestly, naturally,
            and courageously — while still choosing growth.

          <p>
              <h2>Quiet Admiration</h2>

          <p>
          I admire quietly.
          I care silently.
          Not every feeling needs an announcement to be real.
          </p>

          <p>
          There is something about the color red that always catches my attention —
          red in her clothes, a hint of red somewhere,
          a red background, red lipstick.
          Not loud. Not dramatic.
          Just red — calm, confident, and beautiful.
          (Of course, not the kind that bleeds.)
          </p>

          <h2>The Way I Feel</h2>

          <p>
          I don’t compliment loudly.
          I notice things.
          I appreciate people around me,
          but my words usually stay soft, private.
          </p>

          <p>
          I am shy.
          I overthink.
          I think about everything — moments, expressions,
          things said, and things left unsaid.
          I analyze quietly, mostly in my mind.
          </p>

          <h2>What I Value</h2>

          <p>
          I don’t believe in showing off.
          I don’t boast about myself.
          </p>

          <p>
          I believe in care —
          the kind that shows up consistently,
          the kind that doesn’t need proof.
          </p>

          <p>
          I am both sympathetic and empathetic.
          I try to understand how people feel,
          not just what they say.
          I like strong, opinionated girl but at the same time, they should be understanding as well. Not only about her. Bond(any) should matter to her as well.
          I like big face btw but that doesnot means I hate small face people.
          </p>

          <p>
          I value time.
          I try to be punctual,
          because being present matters to me.
          </p>

          <h2>When I Feel Safe</h2>

          <p>
          I’m not very expressive until I feel comfortable.
          But once I do,
          I open up completely.
          </p>

          <p>
          I talk more.
          I laugh more.
          I care deeper.
          (You might even wish I stayed quiet sometimes.)
          </p>

          <h2>Still Growing</h2>

          <p>
          I like to grow.
          I like to listen.
          I believe love — if it ever comes —
          should feel like growth, not pressure.
          </p>

          <p>
          This is how I am.
          Soft with feelings.
          Quiet with love.
          And honest when it truly matters.

          <p>
          I can wait.
          </p>

          <p>
          I can wait while you take your time changing your clothes.<br>
          I can wait while you are still inside the washroom.<br>
          I can wait while you eat slowly and enjoy your meal.<br>
          I can wait while you watch a movie and let the moments last.
          </p>

          <p>
          I can wait for you to live your life at your own pace.
          </p>

          <p>
          But when it comes to your message, waiting feels different.
          </p>

          <p>
          I don’t ask for long conversations. But I love doing.<br>
          I don’t ask for constant attention.<br>
          Just a small reply.<br>
          A quick response.<br>
          A simple sign that says, <em>I’m here.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
          Because waiting for moments is easy<br>
          when I know I matter in them.
          </p>

          <p>
          And sometimes, a message is not just a message —<br>
          it’s reassurance.(Don't take reasssurance in bad way)

               <h2>The Way I Love</h2>

            <p>
            The way I love is simple,
            yet often unnoticed —
            I stay.
            </p>

            <p>
            In a world that celebrates excitement,
            grand gestures,
            and loud expressions,
            people forget how rare staying truly is.
            </p>

            <p>
            Staying is not dramatic.
            It doesn’t demand attention.
            But it carries weight.
            </p>

            <p>
            If someone chooses to stay for me,
            I become deeply devoted to them.
            Not because I have to,
            but because my heart understands the value of that choice.
            </p>

            <p>
            Anyone can stay when things are easy.
            Anyone can stay when love feels light.
            </p>

            <p>
            But staying when things are uncertain,
            when emotions are heavy,
            when silence replaces words —
            that is where love quietly becomes real.
            </p>

            <p>
            To me, staying is a form of romance.
            </p>

            <p>
            Not roses every day.
            Not constant words.
            But choosing the same person,
            again and again,
            even on days when it would be easier to leave.
            </p>

            <h2>Presence, My Favorite Language</h2>

            <p>
            Presence matters to me —
            sometimes more than conversations.
            </p>

            <p>
            Even if we are not talking.
            Even if nothing is being said.
            </p>

            <p>
            I find comfort in shared silence,
            in knowing you are there,
            in feeling your presence without needing proof.
            </p>

            <p>
            I don’t need constant reassurance.
            I don’t need explanations every time.
            </p>

            <p>
            Just stay.
            </p>

            <p>
            Sit with me in the quiet.
            Let the world be loud somewhere else.
            </p>

            <p>
            Because when presence is real,
            silence feels warm,
            not empty.
            </p>

            <p>
            That’s how I love —
            softly,
            steadily,
            romantically —
            by staying,
            and by being present.

    <h2>Universe, listen to me.</h2>

    <p>I want to tell you something about myself — about a feeling that grew quietly, without permission, without planning.</p>

    <p>I wasn’t looking for anyone. I wasn’t searching for love or even companionship. I was just living my routine. And then one day, unknowingly, she came and sat where I was sitting. I remember thinking, <em>Who is she?</em> At first, she felt like just another girl in the room. Nothing special. Nothing extraordinary.</p>

    <p>But days passed.</p>

    <p>We kept sitting near each other. I am an introvert. Opening up does not come easily to me. Conversations don’t flow naturally from me. But slowly, very slowly, there were small talks. Short exchanges. Occasional laughter. Sometimes we just sat silently beside each other.</p>

    <p>She would often be in her own world, watching reels, smiling at her phone. She seemed strong. She seemed happy. Not overly serious about life — just light, present, and genuinely happy.</p>

    <p>And somehow, I started liking that about her.</p>

    <p>I don’t know when it happened. I don’t know why. But I began enjoying her presence. There was something comforting about it. One day, she attended only half the class and left early. And I felt an unexpected emptiness. It was strange. It felt as if she had quietly filled a space inside me that I didn’t even know was empty. And when she wasn’t there, that space felt hollow again.</p>

    <p>Of course, I didn’t say anything. I am not very expressive. I kept it to myself, like I usually do.</p>

    <p>One day, she casually said, “Chalo chai pe.” Let’s go for tea. I went with her. It felt simple. Normal. But meaningful to me.</p>

    <p>While we were drinking tea, the cup slipped and the hot tea spilled on her hands and clothes. It wasn’t a serious burn, but that sharp heat you feel when something hot touches your skin.</p>

    <p>I wanted to ask if she was okay. I wanted to react properly. To do something more. But I froze. Introversion isn’t just silence; sometimes it’s hesitation at the wrong moment.</p>

    <p>Later, when she was heading back to her hostel, I didn’t go with her. I got nervous. I didn’t know what to say, how to react, how to be. She said, “You stay, I will manage.” And I stayed.</p>

    <p>That moment felt like a failure, regret.</p>

    <p>I wanted to go with her. I wanted to show care. But I couldn’t move past my own hesitation.</p>

    <p>After she left, I couldn’t even finish my tea. It didn’t taste right anymore. I threw it away.</p>

    <p>I confirmed about the hand, is it okay? Yes, it was.</p>
  
    <p>Another day, I told her that whenever she is with her friends and I see her, I walk away. I wasn’t trying to ignore her. I was trying to explain who I am — that I am shy, that I overthink. I didn’t want her to misunderstand and think I was purposely avoiding her or acting distant. I just didn’t want her to feel hurt.</p>

    <p>But inside, there were many things I never said.</p>

    <h2>About Her</h2>

    <p>She is a good teacher. The way she explained concepts to me — patiently, clearly — it reminded me of how a madam teaches a five-year-old child. Not in a belittling way, but in a caring way(very caring). She would break things down simply, make sure I understood</p>

    <p>I would sit there thinking, how can someone be this kind? This patient? This gentle?</p>

    <p>It wasn’t just about the lessons. It was about the way she carried herself — with kindness. With softness. With a natural warmth that didn’t try too hard.</p>

    <p>Maybe that’s when I realized what I liked about her wasn’t just her vibe, or the way she talked, or her smile. It was her nature. The quiet goodness in her.</p>

    <p>I had to learn manything from her. But fate has not decided it yet...</p>

    <p>And I never really said any of this out loud.</p>

    <h2>The Shift</h2>

    <p>In between all of this, something unexpected happened. I searched for her on Instagram without asking her. I don’t know why I did it — maybe curiosity, maybe just wanting to know a little more about her world. What surprised me was that when I typed only half of her name, her profile appeared instantly. It felt strange. Almost unreal. Like the universe wanted that connection to happen easily.</p>

    <p>We followed each other. We connected. And for a while, everything felt normal. Good, even.</p>

    <p>Then suddenly, on the evening of January 13th, she messaged me: “Oyee, kal mai aage baithungi, seat mat bachana.” Just like that. Out of nowhere.</p>

    <p>I remember reading it again and again, wondering what had changed.</p>

    <p>I asked her gently if she felt bad about something. She replied, “Nhi, relax. New topic is starting. I will study. I can’t see the board from the side.” We used to sit on the left side.</p>

    <p>But she forgot something — I am not dumb. I understand shifts in tone. I understand distance. I just don’t always question it out loud. I felt that something had changed. Maybe I was overthinking. Maybe it was something small. Maybe it was even related to the tea incident. I’m not sure. But I sensed it wasn’t just about the board.</p>

    <p>Then she said, “Paper mein milte hain.”</p>

    <p>On exam day, she arrived. For a moment, I thought maybe things were still okay. But as soon as the examiner announced that everyone would sit according to their roll numbers, she left immediately.</p>

    <p>That hurt more than I expected.</p>

    <p>It wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t confrontational. But it felt like distance made visible.</p>

    <p>As usual, I didn’t say anything.</p>

    <h2>Feelings I Never Said</h2>

    <p>My birthday was approaching. I had thought maybe I would tell her. Maybe we would do something small — a tea, a casual celebration. Nothing big. Just a moment.</p>

    <p>But before anything like that could happen, she had already changed her seat permanently. The space beside me was felt very empty.</p>

    <p>I started feeling that maybe she didn’t want to be close. Maybe she didn’t want to be a good friend. And I didn’t want to force myself into someone’s space where I wasn’t wanted. So I stayed quiet.</p>

    <p>After that, whenever our paths crossed, we exchanged simple “hi” and “hello.” Healthy, polite conversations. Nothing heavy. Nothing awkward. Just surface-level normalcy.</p>

    <p>But underneath that normalcy, there were unsaid things.</p>

    <p>Her eyes.<br>
    Her smile.</p>

    <p>I had never seen or felt a smile like hers before. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t dramatic. It was calm. Deep. Peaceful. The kind of smile that doesn't try to impress but still steals everything.</p>

    <p>Honestly, it felt like the world paused when she smiled. As if the air stopped moving. As if the noise around us disappeared.</p>

    <p>“Jitna tarif karu, utna kam hai.”</p>

    <p>Her hair. The way she used that clutcher. The white check shirt — she looked exactly like a daisy in it.</p>

    <p>Somewhere between noticing and admiring, I fell. Quietly. Deeply.</p>

      <p>
        A girl who looks like a child sometimes — innocent, playful, smiling without calculation — and at the same time carries the strength of a mature woman. That contrast pulls me in deeply.
        </p>

    <h2>The Confession</h2>

    <p>One day, I decided I had to tell her. I asked her out. When she said yes, I was genuinely happy. But also nervous. Everything inside me felt “hochpoch” — excitement, fear, hope, doubt — all mixed together.</p>

    <p>Still, I told her how I see her. How I admire her. How she looks to me. How I pursue her in my thoughts.</p>

    <p>She listened. She smiled. She seemed happy. And so I was happy.</p>

    <p>She said, “You’re looking serious.”</p>

    <p>Of course I was serious. I had never felt like this before. And when something touches your heart silently and deeply, you don't treat it lightly. I didn't want to loose someone who had unknowingly taken my heart.</p>

    <p>I was never in a hurry with love. I believe in staying. I believe in presence. but I realized that my training deadline was approaching. Time was moving. And soemtimes you feeel that if you don't speak now, you may never get the chance again. </p>

    <p>So I chose courage over silence.</p>

    <p>
      After holding all those feelings inside for so long, something in me changed. I started thinking I want to say, express my feelings at least on.

<p>Her eyes.<br>
Her smile.</p>

I had never seen a smile like hers before. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t dramatic. It was calm… deep… peaceful. The kind of smile that doesn’t try to impress but still steals everything. Honestly, in those moments, it felt like the world paused. As if the air stopped moving. As if the noise around us disappeared.

I couldn’t focus on anything else when she smiled like that. My heart was like WoW, I can watch it for life.

The more I try to praise her smile, the less it feels enough. “Jitna tarif karu, utna kam hai.”
Her smile attracted me more than anything.
<br>
Her hair.
The way she used that clutcher.
The clothes she wore.
<br>
And that white check shirt — she looked exactly like a daisy in it. Soft. Simple. Beautiful without trying. Ahh… I could go on, but words start failing after a point.

And somewhere in between noticing and admiring, I fell. Quietly. Deeply.
<br>
One day, after carrying this inside for too long, I decided I had to tell her how I felt. So I asked her out. When she said yes, I was happy — genuinely happy. But at the same time, I was nervous. My mind was running with hundreds of thoughts at once. Everything felt “hochpoch” inside — excitement, fear, hope, doubt — all mixed together.
<br>
Still, I told her.
<br>
I told her how I see her.
How I admire her.
How she looks to me.
How I pursue her in my thoughts.
<br>
She listened. She smiled. She seemed happy.

And because she was happy, I was happy.
<br>
She told me, “You’re looking serious.”
Of course I was serious.
<br>
Because I had never felt like this before.
And when something touches your heart silently and deeply, you don’t treat it lightly. I didn’t want to lose someone who had unknowingly taken my heart.
<br>
I was never in a hurry with love. I believe in staying. I believe in presence. But I realized that my training deadline was approaching. Time was moving. And sometimes you feel that if you don’t speak now, you may never get the chance again.
<br>
So I chose courage over silence.      
      </p>

      <p>
          On the last day, I knew something very clearly — if nothing happened between us, we probably wouldn’t see each other again like before. Different paths. Different routines. Maybe no more sitting side by side. That thought was heavy.
          <br>
          So we sat together.
          <br>
I spoke what I had to speak. Not dramatically. Not perfectly. Just honestly. She was happy listening to me. I could see it. And that gave me a little peace.
<br>
I didn’t say “I love you.”
But I tried to convey my feelings in whatever way felt right to me. In the tone of my voice. In the seriousness on my face. In the way I chose my words carefully.
<br>
I even had a plan. At one point, it came into my mind to shower flowers on her. I had already imagined it. I had made plans in my head. It was innocent. Pure. The way I felt.
<br>
But sometimes things don’t go the way you think.
<br>
She said, “Don’t do this… don’t do that… blah blah blah…”
<br>
And I was hurt from inside. Quietly hurt. But I tried not to show it. I didn’t want the moment to become heavy. I didn’t want her to feel pressured.
<br>
I had already told her clearly, “I am not expecting anything from you. Only if you feel it.”
I can’t force her for anything. I don’t want to. Feelings can’t be forced.
<br>
She got nervous. I could feel it. There was a shift in her energy.
<br>
After talking for a while, she got busy with her friends. And I left with a heavy heart.
<br>
Even now, when I think about it, everything starts running in the back of my head. Every word. Every expression. Every small reaction. It keeps replaying. Sometimes I wonder… maybe we are not even friends anymore.
<br>
But one thing I know — if she hadn’t left that day earlier, I might never have said anything to her. Maybe I would have continued keeping it inside. In a strange way, she did good by leaving that seat. That distance gave my feelings the courage to finally speak.
<br>
And honestly, all credit goes to her. She made me feel comfortable enough to open up. I never felt judged. I never felt small. I felt safe in that moment.
<br>
In my whole life, this was the first time I opened up in front of a girl like this.
<br>
And for that, I am thankful.
<br>
Thanks to her. Thanks to God.

      </p>

      <h2>For Life</h2>
      <p>But for me, it has never been about something temporary.
<br>
I don’t enter someone’s life casually. I don’t come with a “let’s see how long this lasts” mindset. That’s not who I am. If I step into someone’s world, I come with loyalty. I come with the intention to stay.
<br>
I am not built for temporary attachments.
<br>
If I am there, I am there for life.
<br>
I don’t know how to give half-efforts. I don’t know how to feel halfway. When I care, I care deeply. When I choose someone, I choose with the thought of permanence, not convenience.
<br>
There is nothing temporary in me.</p>
<br>
<p>Sometimes, I don't know how, but I make things complicated for me.</p>

<p>
  I never wanted to say, but my heart told if you fell that strong, unique, beautiful. I want to keep. So, I tried.
  Only I said about date, because I she wanted to know about me, then it will be good. but she don't care..
</p>

But I am 100% sure, it would be a nice journey with her.
